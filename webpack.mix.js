/*
Your Spark Plugin webpack utilizes laravel mix in order to easily compile 
your static resources.  Refer to the Laravel Mix documentation at 
https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix for information on how to configure 
mix to compile additional resources. 

The compiled resources will be put in 
your plugin's public folder which can then be published. For information 
on how to publish your plugin's resources, review
https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/packages#public-assets for information.  Your plugin 
service provider located at src/PluginServiceProvider.php already has the public 
folder configured for publishing by default.
